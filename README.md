# Traffic light controller simulator (extended version)

This is an extension activity for an undergraduate FPGA lab.

The testbench is modified from another project that I work on. The testbench facility only supports Verilog, therefore the VHDL source was compiled into Verilog with GHDL for testing purposes.
